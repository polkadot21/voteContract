# Vote Smart app

This is a smart contract developed for fair voting.
Only the owner of the contract can suggest candidates and start the voting.
The voting is open for the next three days and, after the time has passed, every contributor can close the voting. Every contributor can only contribute once with 0.01 eth.

The winner (one of candidates with the largest amount of eth collected) acquires 90% of the entire contribution pool, whereas the owner acquires 10% of the contribution pool.
